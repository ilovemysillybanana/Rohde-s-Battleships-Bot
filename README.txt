Hi there! :)

This is my first project I have uploaded to github, and at the moment of writing, I'm new to version control systems.

Rohde's Battleships Bot is a bot that can play Battleship. Check the file "GameRules.txt" for information on how the bot works, and which versions of battleship it plays :)
